The project's **SOM ramps from $180–250k in Year 1 (2026) to $3.5–5.2M by Year 5 (2030)**, equating to **0.8–1.2% of metro food‑service** and up to **11.6% of institutional demand**, under conservative yield and pricing assumptions benchmarked to existing CEA operators.

#### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

**Midwest Fresh Produce Market (2024): $25.0 - 30.0 Billion**

The Midwest fresh produce market represents approximately 25-30% of the U.S. fruits and vegetables market, which was valued at **USD 100.07 billion in 2024** and projected to reach **USD 127.61 billion by 2030** at a **4.1% CAGR**. The Midwest region (encompassing Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and Missouri) captures an estimated **$25-30 billion** of this national market.

**Michigan Vegetable Industry Contribution:**

Michigan's vegetable farming and processing sectors alone generate **$5.39 billion annually** to the state economy, with **$1.19 billion in direct farm sales** and **$1.92 billion in processing sales**. Michigan produces **50% of the nation's fresh asparagus, 30% of cucumbers, and 25% of squash**, demonstrating the state's agricultural dominance and established distribution infrastructure.

| Year 2 (2027) | 12,000-15,000 sq ft | $800,000-$1.1M | Facility expansion; automation integration |
| Year 3 (2028) | 20,000-25,000 sq ft | $1.8M-$2.4M | Multi-crop diversification; regional distribution |
| Year 4 (2029) | 28,000-35,000 sq ft | $2.6M-$3.6M | Functional foods R&D; university partnerships |

**Market Penetration Analysis:**

By Year 5 (2030), revenue of **$3.5-5.2 million** represents:

- **0.8-1.2% of Grand Rapids metro food service market** ($580-720M SAM)

- **0.04-0.07% of U.S. vertical farming market** (projected $2.5-3.0B by 2030)

**Conservative capture rationale:**

- **Competition:** Edible Garden Heartland's existing 5-acre facility represents primary local competitor
- **Consumer price sensitivity:** 2024 vertical farming failures highlight premium pricing challenges
- **Institutional procurement cycles:** K-12 and healthcare purchasing requires 18-24 month relationship development
