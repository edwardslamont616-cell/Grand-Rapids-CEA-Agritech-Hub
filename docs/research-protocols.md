# 🔬 Research Protocols

This document outlines the standardized research frameworks for the Grand Rapids CEA Agritech Hub. Our goal is to provide a transparent, replicable foundation for urban agriculture innovation.

## 1. Nutrient Density & Crop Quality
We track 12+ phytochemical and mineral markers to validate the "Food as Medicine" value proposition.
- **HPLC Analysis:** Quarterly testing for vitamins and bioactive compounds.
- **Comparative Baseline:** Benchmarking against USDA standard reference data and regional conventional produce.

## 2. Energy Use Intensity (EUI) & Efficiency
Protocols for measuring the environmental footprint of our vertical farming systems.
- **Lighting Efficiency:** PPFD mapping across vertical stacks to optimize LED array performance.
- **HVAC/Climate Control:** Real-time monitoring of VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit) vs. energy consumption.

## 3. Data Integrity & Open Access
All research data is processed through our Digital Twin architecture.
- **Anonymized Datasets:** Shared with academic partners (MSU) via the `OpenData` standard.
- **Peer Review:** Encouraging independent validation of yield and resource-use claims.
