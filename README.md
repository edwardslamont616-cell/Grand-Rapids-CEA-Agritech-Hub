Grand Rapids CEA Agritech Hub

A landmark urban agriculture project in Grand Rapids, Michigan, demonstrating how integrated Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) can deliver resilient, local, and sustainable food systems.
 Project Overview

The Grand Rapids CEA Agritech Hub is a 100,000 sq ft, six-layer vertical farming facility powered by on-site renewable energy.[page:1] It integrates advanced hydroponics, climate control, automation, and data analytics to enable year-round, pesticide-free food production with drastically reduced water and land use.

Key objectives:

- Strengthen **regional** food resilience by localizing production and shortening supply chains.
- Mitigate climate, geopolitical, and pandemic-related disruptions to traditional agriculture.
- Provide a scalable, replicable blueprint for urban agritech facilities in other cities.
Core Features

Integrated CEA Ecosystem

The hub uses six interconnected technology layers to create a self-sustaining agricultural environment.

- Renewable energy: 400 kW Grand River–powered micro-turbine supplying clean electricity for operations.
- Hydroponic systems: Advanced nutrient delivery that maximizes yield while minimizing resource consumption.
- Climate control: Precision HVAC systems maintaining optimal growing conditions year-round.
- IoT monitoring: Real-time sensors tracking environmental conditions and crop health metrics.
- Automated harvesting: Robotic systems for planting, tending, and harvesting to reduce labor costs.
- Data analytics: AI-powered insights optimizing production cycles and predicting maintenance.
