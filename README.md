## 🚀 Vision
**We are building the operating system for the next generation of urban agriculture.**

The Grand Rapids CEA Agritech Hub at 555 Monroe is a proposed mixed-use facility designed to validate the **Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA)** model for the Midwest. By combining **vertical farming infrastructure**, **AI-driven climate control**, and **public-facing research**, we aim to solve the "urban food paradox": high demand for fresh, local produce met by fragile, long-distance supply chains.

This repository serves as the **digital twin** and **open knowledge base** for the project, providing transparent access to feasibility studies, energy models, and impact metrics for investors, researchers, and community stakeholders.

## 📍 Why Grand Rapids?
Grand Rapids, Michigan, offers a unique "Goldilocks" environment for CEA innovation:
* **Market Demand:** A $104.7B state agriculture economy with a localized gap in winter production.
* **Water Access:** Situated in the Great Lakes basin, offering water security unavailable to Western US competitors.
* **Institutional Density:** Direct proximity to **Michigan State University AgBioResearch**, **Grand Rapids SmartZone**, and a robust food manufacturing supply chain.
* **Climate Advantage:** Lower cooling costs than Southern vertical farms; leveraging hybrid greenhouse models for energy efficiency.

## 🎯 Impact Metrics & Goals
We measure success through a quadruple-bottom-line framework:

| Metric Category | Target Outcomes | Stakeholder Alignment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🌱 Agritech Innovation** | Digital twin validation, open-source crop data, AI climate optimization. | *Alex Insight, Evelyn Evergreen* |
| **🏥 Health & Community** | Measured increase in local nutrient density, "Food as Medicine" pilot programs. | *Jordan Cause, Dr. Riley Nutra* |
| **🏭 Commercial Ops** | Viable unit economics, B2B local procurement pilots, supply chain redundancy. | *Casey Builder, Sam Culinary* |
| **🎓 Workforce/STEM** | K-16 curriculum integration, internships, green job creation. | *Dean Parker, Casey Builder* |

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (Proposed)
* **Hardware:** Hybrid vertical racking systems, broad-spectrum LED arrays, IoT sensor mesh (Temp, RH, CO2, VPD).
* **Software:** Python-based climate modeling, OpenComputerVision for crop health monitoring, Digital Twin architecture.
* **Data:** Open data standards for researchers to validate yield and resource efficiency.
