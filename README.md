# Grand Rapids CEA Agritech Hub (555 Monroe)
### Open-Source Framework for Urban Food Resilience & Workforce Innovation

![CEA Hub Visualization]()

## 🚀 Vision
**We are building the operating system for the next generation of urban agriculture.** 

The Grand Rapids CEA Agritech Hub at 555 Monroe is a proposed mixed-use facility designed to validate the **Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA)** model for the Midwest. By combining **vertical farming infrastructure**, **AI-driven climate control**, and **public-facing research**, we aim to solve the "urban food paradox": high demand for fresh, local produce met by fragile, long-distance supply chains.

This repository serves as the **digital twin** and **open knowledge base** for the project, providing transparent access to feasibility studies, energy models, and impact metrics for investors, researchers, and community stakeholders.

## 📍 Why Grand Rapids?
Grand Rapids, Michigan, offers a unique "Goldilocks" environment for CEA innovation:
*   **Market Demand:** A $104.7B state agriculture economy with a localized gap in winter production.
*   **Water Access:** Situated in the Great Lakes basin, offering water security unavailable to Western US competitors.
*   **Institutional Density:** Direct proximity to **Michigan State University AgBioResearch**, **Grand Rapids SmartZone**, and a robust food manufacturing supply chain.
*   **Climate Advantage:** Lower cooling costs than Southern vertical farms; leveraging hybrid greenhouse models for energy efficiency.

Key objectives:

- Strengthen **regional** food resilience by localizing production and shortening supply chains.
- Mitigate climate, geopolitical, and pandemic-related disruptions to traditional agriculture.
- Provide a scalable, replicable blueprint for urban agritech facilities in other cities.
Core Features

Integrated CEA Ecosystem

The hub uses six interconnected technology layers to create a self-sustaining agricultural environment.

- Renewable energy: 400 kW Grand River–powered micro-turbine supplying clean electricity for operations.
- Hydroponic systems: Advanced nutrient delivery that maximizes yield while minimizing resource consumption.
- Climate control: Precision HVAC systems maintaining optimal growing conditions year-round.
- IoT monitoring: Real-time sensors tracking environmental conditions and crop health metrics.
- Automated harvesting: Robotic systems for planting, tending, and harvesting to reduce labor costs.
- Data analytics: AI-powered insights optimizing production cycles and predicting maintenance.
